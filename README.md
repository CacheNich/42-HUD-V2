# 42-HUD-V2
The new version of 42-HUD with more polish and minimalist style.

Make sure to go to 42-HUD ALT --> resource --> fonts  and install typoslab_demo and crosshair fonts.

There are built in crosshairs to the hud, with Konr Wings that flash color when damage is done. Go to 42-HUD ALT --> Scripts --> hudlayout (for the crosshair) or --> hudanimations_tf (for the animated crosshairs).

Look at the bottom of the hudlayout.res for crosshairs 
Look at the bottom middle of the hudanimations_tf.txt (look for event DamagedPlayer for info and changes)

There are a few files that can be exchanged for different options. There is a scoreboard option, 3 health cross options,
and a targetID option.
NOTE: If you use hudplayerhealth-HPCROSS2, make sure you use the corresponding huddamageaccount for intended effect.
In order to use these, just rename the old file something else and rename the new file to the regular name (IE hudplayerhealth-HPCROSS2 --> hudplayerhealth and old hudplayerhealth --> hudplayerhealth-RG)
