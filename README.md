# 42-HUD-V2
The new version of 42-HUD with more polish and minimalist style.

Hi. There are built in crosshairs to the hud, with Konr Wings that flash color when damage is done. Go to 42-HUD ALT --> Scripts
--> hudlayout (for the crosshair) or --> hudanimations_tf (for the animated crosshairs).

Look at the bottom of the hudlayout.res for crosshairs 
Look at the bottom middle of the hudanimations_tf.txt (look for event DamagedPlayer for info and changes)

Tell me any bugs or critique at cachenich@gmail.com or the TF.TV forum:
